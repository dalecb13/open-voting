# Open Voting

**Open Voting** is an idea that explores different types of voting systems in order to design a system that works for everyone.

## Description

The goal of a voting system is to ensure that the needs and wishes of the people are represented fairly and equally in a system of delegated power. A system of delegated power arises as a response to organizing policy and labor among a group of individuals that have a shared interest. Over time as labor and interests become more specialized, the existing fabric can become crystalized and fragmented. This fragmentation can cause divides between groups within a population. Eventually one or more fragments will become the majority, and the remainder, minorities, and voices well be unheard. In addition, power and money drive and accelerate this fragmentation, and eventually create a system where only the majority is able to make decisions for everyone.
